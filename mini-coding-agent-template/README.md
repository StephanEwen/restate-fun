# Interruptible Coding Agent Mock

A simple demo illustrating how to build an interruptible coding agent using Restate and TypeScript.

## How to run it

Start the service

```bash
npm run dev
```

In a separate terminal, start the web interface:

```bash
npm run ui
```

Run Restate Server and use the Restate UI (at `localhost:9070`) to register the application (running at `http://localhost:9080`)


Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` for the mock agent UI.
